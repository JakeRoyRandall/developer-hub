## The Philosophy of MPL-404

MPL-404 is the next evolution of the SPL-404 hybrid standard developed and popularized by Mutant Labs and Mutantmon. 

There are two fundamental observations that preceded SPL-404. The first is the dramatic divergence of outcomes between fungibles and non-fungibles. While memecoins (fungibles) can reach multi-billion dollar market caps and centi-million dollar trading volumes, the most successful NFTs struggle to reach 1/100th of that success. This is perhaps strange considering that on Solana the two underlying asset standards are extremely similar. This performance divergence holds true across blockchains.

The second observation was that fungible assets market cap was positively correlated with holder distribution. In other words, memecoins can go viral-- indeed their success depends on it. The more widespread the meme, the larger the communuty, the higher the market cap as a generalization.

This is in start contrast with traditional NFTs, whose limited & minimal supply is **anti-viral** and stunts community growth. This inability to grow your community has lead to multiple projects releasing additional NFT collections, which ultimately is an innefective way of scaling your community. One of the reasons is because the sudden increase of supply often has negative price effects and upsetting your existing community. Between the project and it's holders there is incentive misalignment. Additional collections also create exosystem complexity and project overhead as the disperate collections are not intrensically tied to each other and each has to be managed.

While the traditional NFT model can work well for small exclusive communities, for global brands & gaming applications the inability to easily scale makes traditional NFTs a poor choice. Bonk, with over 700k holders is a much bigger global brand than any 10k supply collection.

Enter MPL-404.

By backing one or more NFT collections with a fungible token, NFT projects can now finally build scalable, sustainable ecosystems. Beyond the benefits of liquidity and gamification, it's scaling that is the killer feature of MPL-404.

If our little corner of the internet is to ever move from niche to mainstream, it's the growth & scaling of the best projects that will be the difference. MPL-404 is not just a technical solution, but an economic solution to this fundamental issue.
