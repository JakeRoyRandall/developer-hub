## Is MPL-404 a new token standard??

Not quite. MPL-404 is not a token standard, it’s a “meta” standard for hybrid assets facilitated by a dynamic swap program. To put it another way, it’s the bridge between a sets of fungible and non-fungible tokens.


## Which types of assets does MPL-404 support?

Currently MPL-404 only supports Metaplex Core NFT assets and token metadata fungible assets. We are working to support other token standards including pNFTs & Token-2022.


## How can I provide liquidity to my token?

Providing liquidity is a complex topic beyond the scope of MPL-404. The token escrow is different than a liquidity pool. To learn more about setting up a liquidity pool for your project, please visit Raydium, Orca, Meteora.


## How is MPL-404 different from ERC-404?

While the roots of MPL-404, SPL-404, are inspired by the Ethereum hybrid standard ERC-404, the standards are quite different. ERC-404 assets act like both a fungible and non-fungible asset at the same time, while MPL-404 assets can fluidly move between the two states, taking advantage of the best features of both. Additionally, MPL-404 allows for advanced swap gamification, serving as a new source of revenue for projects.
